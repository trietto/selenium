# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability in Selenium, or a dependency we use, please come speak to us on [Slack](https://selenium.dev/support).

Please join the `#selenium-tlc` channel and say that you believe you have found a security issue. 
One of the [Selenium TLC members](https://www.selenium.dev/structure/#tlc) 
will send you a direct message to understand the problem. Once the problem is understood a newly created private channel
will be created by the TLC Member and you will be invited to explain the problem further with the rest of the TLC members.

Please provide a [concise reproducible test case](http://sscce.org/) and describe what results you are seeing and what results you expect.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-contributions)
